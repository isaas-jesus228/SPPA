# SPPA
With this app, you can view and explore different curves defined parametrically or in a polar coordinate system.

After a short study of regular graphs, I strongly recommend that you study "Degree Graphs". This is a checkbox under all the parameters, where degrees are used instead of radians, resulting in extremely unusual options for the polar rose. I hope that if you find this, you will enjoy it and be as surprised by the degree graphs as I am!

If you are only interested in the program, follow the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QIjjeEFN5EWtpC_IYNGl_20YAsYwbtl?usp=drive_link">links</a> and download the archive.

This is "Degree Graph"
